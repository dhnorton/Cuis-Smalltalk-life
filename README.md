## Cuis-Smalltalk-life
The game of Life is an example of cellular automaton. It was developed by Prof. John H. Conway at the University of Cambridge. Cells are displayed on a grid, analogous to graph paper, and live or die by the following rules:

- a live cell surrounded by 2 or 3 other live cells will continue to live
- a live cell surrounded by 0 or 1 other live cells will die of loneliness
- a dead cell surrounded by exactly 3 live cells will come alive
- a cell surrounded by 4 or more live cells will die of overcrowding



After loading the package, start the game by executing (Cmd-d) the following in a workspace:



- LifeView example1



The popup menu, displayed by clicking Mouse button 2, presents the following choices:


- Run/Pause
- Step
- Stop
- Clear
- Load...
- Experiment...

Dozens of patterns are available for loading.
